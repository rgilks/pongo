## Principles

- Keep changes small and test each step.
- Refactor for clarity: simple, elegant, maintainable.
- Improve tests, docs, and diagrams continuously.
- Remove dead or commented-out code.
- Use whitespace for readability.
- Keep functions < 20 lines; files < 200 lines.

## Technology preferences

- Prefer WebGPU via `wgpu` v24.0; avoid WebGL2 fallbacks.
- Prefer Node for servers/tooling; never use Python.

## Logging

- Ensure logs are sufficient for debugging and monitoring.

## Testing

- Maintain a `TEST-PLAN.md` document with a set of manual tests that you will run by automating the web browser this is in place of puppeteer or playwright tests.
- Rust unit tests live alongside code: run `cargo test`.
- Full check: `npm run check` runs:
  - `cargo fmt --check` and `cargo clippy -D warnings`
  - `cargo test` (workspace, excluding `app-web`)
  - Web CI build + headless test

## Pre-commit and push

- Update `README.md`, `TEST-PLAN.md` and `SPEC.md`.
- Fix warnings where possible.
- Commit and push only after the above succeed.
